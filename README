Printer version 0.0.3.1
====================
(I would like to quickly mention that this module is not based off any other module, despite the fact that it has the letters 'Ez' in it's name.)

    The Ez Printer is a module that I am currently developing in hopes that it will come in handy and be found useful by all those that choose to investigate its potential; there isn't much it can do just yet.  Currently, all it can really do is print a single character using 'putc' and print a string using 'puts', although I have not--as of yet--tried to do so with either of them beyond what I did in the test files for this module.  

INSTALLATION
